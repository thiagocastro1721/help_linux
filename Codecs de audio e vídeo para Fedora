Multimedia on Fedora

Once RPM Fusion is configured (see https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration)

Switch to full ffmpeg

Fedora ffmpeg-free works most of the time, but one will experience version missmatch from time to time. Switch to the rpmfusion provided ffmpeg build that is better supported. You will still need to follow the next section for additional codecs or plugins related to packages you might have installed.

sudo dnf swap ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing

There you don't need libavcodec-freeworld that is only meant to complement the ffmpeg-free package (and related libraries).

Install additional codec

This will allows the application using the gstreamer framework and other multimedia software, to play others restricted codecs:

    The following command will install the complements multimedia packages needed by gstreamer enabled applications:

    sudo dnf update @multimedia --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin


Hardware Accelerated Codec

Intel(recent)

# Using the rpmfusion-nonfree section

sudo dnf install intel-media-driver

Intel(older)

# Using the rpmfusion-free section

sudo dnf install libva-intel-driver

Hardware codecs with AMD (mesa)

# Using the rpmfusion-free section This is needed since Fedora 37 and later... and mainly concern AMD hardware since NVIDIA hardware with nouveau doesn't work well

sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers mesa-va-drivers-freeworld
sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld

If using i686 compat libraries (for steam or alikes):

sudo dnf swap mesa-va-drivers.i686 mesa-va-drivers-freeworld.i686
sudo dnf swap mesa-vdpau-drivers.i686 mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld.i686

Hardware codecs with NVIDIA

The Nvidia proprietary driver doesn't support VAAPI natively, but there is a wrapper that can bridge NVDEC/NVENC with VAAPI

sudo dnf install libva-nvidia-driver

You can also install both 32bit and 64bit flavor in one command as needed.

sudo dnf install libva-nvidia-driver.{i686,x86_64}


Play a DVD

You need to have the libdvdcss package, to install libdvdcss you need enable tainted repos.

    Tainted free is dedicated for FLOSS packages where some usages might be restricted in some countries.

    sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted
    sudo dnf install libdvdcss

Various firmwares

    Tainted nonfree is dedicated to non-FLOSS packages without a clear redistribution status by the copyright holder. But is allowed as part of hardware inter-operability between operating systems in some countries :

    sudo dnf install rpmfusion-nonfree-release-tainted
    sudo dnf --repo=rpmfusion-nonfree-tainted install "*-firmware"
