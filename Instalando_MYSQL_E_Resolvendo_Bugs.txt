BUG
error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)' -- Missing /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

This error occurs due to multiple installations of mysql. Run the command:
ps -A|grep mysql

Kill the process by using:
sudo pkill mysql

and then run command:
ps -A|grep mysqld

Also Kill this process by running:
sudo pkill mysqld

Now you are fully set just run the following commands:

service mysql restart
mysql -u root -p

Have very well working mysql again!
